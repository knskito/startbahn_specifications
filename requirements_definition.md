##<a name="accounts">1. Accounts
startbahn is composed of the following four accounts.
* **General**
* **Artist**
* **Reviewer**
* **Collector**

<!--Pictogram would be here for intuitive understanding.-->  

We can choose only one account and cannot change the role after the decision, except General account.  
(General is an account for understanding overall system of startbahn. Although its function is strictly regulated, General can change its role to one of the other three accounts for once.)

###All accounts can
* follow other accounts.
* edit their own profile.
* thumb up or down reviews.
* mark works, reviews, threads and events.
* post comments on review.
* make or read threads in Forum.
* post events.
* send invitations of startbahn.

###General accounts can
* change its role to Artist, Reviewer or Collector.

###Artist accounts can
* post, edit and remove their artworks on startbahn.
* put their artworks up for Primary Auction.
* obtain re-distribution value through Secondary Auction. (re-distribution system will be described [later](#rd_system) in detail.)

###Reviewer accounts can
* review artworks posted by Artist.
* edit and remove their reviews.
* obtain re-distribution value through Primary and Secondary Auction. (re-distribution system will be described [later](#rd_system) in detail.)

###Collector accounts can
* buy posted artworks as collection by bidding at Primary and Secondary Auction.
* resale their collections on Secondary Auction.

Functions on each accounts are explicitly differentiated according to the real art market.  
We believe artistic value can be incremented online by their interaction.

##<a name="auctions">2. Auctions
Posted artworks can be circulated through the following two auctions in startbahn.
* **Primary Auction**
* **Secondary Auction**  
<!--Pictogram would be here for intuitive understanding.-->  

###Primary Auction
* The auction for **Artist as the seller** and **Collector as the bidder**.
* All bids are sealed that only an Artist as the seller can check the bidder and the price of each bids.
    * Other accounts can only check the number of bids.
* **Artist as the seller can select the buyer regardless of bidding prices after the end of auction.**

###Secondary Auction
* The auction for **Collectors as both the seller and the bidder**.
* All bids are opened that every accounts can check the bidder, price and the number of bids.
* **Collector who bidded the highest price is automatically selected as the buyer at the end of auction.**

Primary Auction is a kind of substitution for gallery system in the real art market; it can prevent from excessive deals just for the short-term profit and can contribute to the development of artistic value in circulated artworks combined with the following re-distribution system.  
<!--Pictogram would be here for intuitive understanding.-->  

##<a name="rd_system">3. Re-Distribution System
Re-distribution system is one of the most unique and important functions in startbahn which can refund the fraction of resale value to artist and reviewer.

### The Model

<!--Pictogram would be here for intuitive understanding.-->  

### Distribution Rates
||Artist|Reviewer|Startbahn, Inc|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Primary Auction|-|7%|5%|
|Seconday Auction|0%~20%|5%|7%|
* **Distribution rate for Artists fluctuates from zero to twenty percent depending on their activities in startbahn.**
    * Determinants and deriving method of the rate are confident.
* If artworks with no reviews would be sold in Auction, startbahn,inc could get refunds originally for Reviewer. (That is, distribution rate for startbahn, inc becomes 12% in both Primary and Secondary Auctions.)
